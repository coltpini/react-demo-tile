# 1.0.0
* Initial release.
* How this is different from the stacks version:
    * This pulls in the themes
    * Added the changelog file
    * We are going to be using propTypes
    * Every component will be declared using the class notation, unless there is a self contained sub component, that won't need propTypes nor class notation.
